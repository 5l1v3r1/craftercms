# Crafter CMS

Crafter CMS is an open source content management system for Web sites, mobile apps, VR and more. You can learn more about Crafter here: http://docs.craftercms.org/en/latest/index.html

This repository is the parent project that builds everything and helps you build one of two things:
1. Deployable Crafter CMS bundle, or
2. Developer's environment so you can compile and contribute to Crafter CMS

#1. Initial Setup
You must have these prerequisites on your system before you begin:
* Java 8
* Git 2.x+
* Maven 3.3.x+

Let's begin :)

```bash
git clone --recursive  https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms.git
```

** Note the `--recursive` required to clone all the git submodules. If you missed `--recursive`, just run `git submodule init` to fix that.

#2. Build a Deployable Bundle
To build a deployable and distributable bundle of Crafter CMS, use the Gradle task `bundle`. This task will generate `.zip` and `.tar.gz` files ready to be deployed to any system.

Archives will named `crafter-cms.tar.gz` and `crafter-cms.zip` and can be found in the `bundles` folder. [Check the Gradle Tasks section for more details.](#4-gradle-tasks)

```bash
./grablew bundle
```

To run Crafter CMS from the bundle, unzip and follow the instructions in the bundle's `README.txt`.

##2.1. Build an Environment Specific Bundle
Crafter CMS is a decoupled CMS, and that means you have an `authoring` environment that caters to content creators, and a different environment, `delivery`, that handles the end-users that use the experience created by the former.

To build a bundle for a specific environment:

```bash
    ./gradlew bundle -Denv=authoring
```
Archives will named `crafter-cms-authoring.tar.gz` and `crafter-cms-authoring.zip` and can be found in the `bundles` folder.

For the `delivery` environment, simply substitute the `env=authoring` with `env=delivery`.

#3. Build a Developer's Environment
Crafter CMS is built along a microservices architecture, and as such, comprises a number of head-less, RESTful, modules that work together to provide the final solution. In this section, we'll start with the simple case of _build everything_/_run everything_, and then move on to building/hacking individual modules.

##3.1. Build, Start and Stop All 
###3.1.1. Build All
Build all Crafter CMS modules, run

```bash
    ./gradlew build
```

###3.1.2. Start All
Start Crafter CMS,
 
 ```bash
    ./gradlew start
```

You can now point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/studio](http://localhost:8080/studio) and start using Crafter CMS. To get started with your first Crafter CMS experience, you can follow this guide: [http://docs.craftercms.org/en/latest/content-authors/index.html](http://docs.craftercms.org/en/latest/content-authors/index.html).

###3.1.3. Stop All
Stop Crafter CMS,

```bash
    ./gradlew stop
```

##3.2. Two Environments: Authoring vs Delivery
You might have noticed that you essentially have two environments built and running: `authoring` and `delivery`. Crafter CMS is a decoupled CMS, and that means you have an `authoring` environment that caters to content creators, and a different environment, `delivery`, that handles the end-users that use the experience created by the former.

As a developer, you can an `authoring` environment only for most tasks without the need to run a `delivery` environment. It's important to note that `delivery` essentially runs the same software that's in `authoring` except Crafter Studio (the authoring tools).

By default, this project will build both environments unless instructed otherwise.

###3.1.1. Build, Start, and Stop a Specific Environment
Much like building/starting/stopping All, to perform the same for one of the two environments.

#### Authoring
```bash
    ./gradlew build -Denv=authoring
    ./gradlew start -Denv=authoring
    ./gradlew stop -Denv=authoring
```

#### Delivery
```bash
    ./gradlew build -Denv=delivery
    ./gradlew start -Denv=delivery
    ./gradlew stop -Denv=delivery
```

##3.3. Crafter Modules
The mechanics for working with a single module are similar to working with _all_, with one exception: You can deploy a module to one or both environments (`authoring`/`delivery`).

Crafter CMS comprises the modules:
* [`core`](http://docs.craftercms.org/en/latest/developers/projects/core/index.html)
* [`commons`](http://docs.craftercms.org/en/latest/developers/projects/commons/index.html)
* [`engine`](http://docs.craftercms.org/en/latest/developers/projects/engine/index.html)
* [`studio`](http://docs.craftercms.org/en/latest/developers/projects/studio/index.html)
* [`search`](http://docs.craftercms.org/en/latest/developers/projects/search/index.html)
* [`profile`](http://docs.craftercms.org/en/latest/developers/projects/profile/index.html)
* [`social`](http://docs.craftercms.org/en/latest/developers/projects/social/index.html)
* [`deployer`](http://docs.craftercms.org/en/latest/developers/projects/deployer/index.html)

You'll find these projects checked out and ready for you to contribute to in the folder `src/{moduleName}`.

###3.3.1. Forking a Module
Start by forking the module you want to work on. You can follow the [GitHub instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
The next step is to switch the upstream repository from the main `craftercms` repo to your own. To make this happen, edit the file `.gitmodules` and change the module's URL to point to your fork. Now, let's force an update:

```bash
    git submodule sync --recursive
```

You can now work in on your local system, and build/deploy and ultimately push to your fork. We welcome code contributions, so please do send us pull-requests.

###3.3.2. Build, Deploy, Start, and Stop a Module
You can build, deploy, start or stop a module by:

```bash
    ./gradlew build -DmoduleName=studio
    ./gradlew deploy -DmoduleName=studio -Denv=authoring
    ./gradlew start -DmoduleName=studio -Denv=authoring
    ./gradlew stop -DmoduleName=studio -Denv=authoring
```

#####Note
* If you don't specify the `env` parameter, it means all environments (where applicable).
* In the current version of Crafter CMS, some services run in the same Web container, and that implies the stopping/starting of one of these services will cause other services to stop/start as well.

2 Create a Development Environment
======

The following steps will guide you on the creation of an authoring of Crafter CMS.

### 2.1 Building a Crafter CMS Authoring environment 

*_An Authoring environment is where an Author can safely create and manage content without impacting the end-user's live system_*.

Once all he sources had been download you can run
```bash
    ./gradlew authEnv
```
The Gradle task above will:

1. Delete any existing _Authoring environment_ in `crafter-auth-env` folder. *It will always make a clean Authoring environment*

2. Download Apache Tomcat and Solr. (Check the Gradle section on how to specified a version of Apache Tomcat an Solr)

3. Build all Crafter CMS modules from the source (check the Git section on how to update the source).

4. Create a folder name `crafter-auth-env` and copy all needed resources for a *clean* and functional Authoring environment.


### 2.2 Run

To run the _Authoring environment_ you can:
* Run the gradle task 

```bash
./gradlew runAuth
```
or
 
* Run it manually 

```bash
cd crafter-auth-env
./startup.sh
```

Both of those options will:

* Start Apache tomcat on default ports (8080,8009,8005) [See Gradle task on how to change default ports](#gradle-tasks)

* Start Solr server on port 8984

* Start Crafter Deployer on port 

### 2.2.1 Authoring Environment Scripts

The Crafter CMS Authoring scripts will help you on the basic startup shutdown of the services needed to run a healthy _Authoring environment_
with

#### crafter(.sh/bat)

Main Script to start,and stop all needed Services to have a functional Crafter CMS _Authoring Environment_

##### Synopsis

`crafter.(sh/bat) start|stop|debug|tail|help`

##### Arguments

* _stop_ Stops all Crafter CMS services in the same order as they start.

* _debug_ Start all Crafter CMS services with the JAVA remote debug port 5005 for Crafter Deployer, 1044 for Solr and 8000 for Apache Tomcat

* _help_  Prints script help

a **Clean** Live environment this means that it will trigger the `liveEnv` task and make sure that your distributable 
files are clean and ready to be un archive.

Archives will be saved in as `crafter-live-env.tar` and `crafter-live-env.zip` in the `distributables` folder
[Check the Gradle Tasks for more information about the livePack task](#4-gradle-tasks)
