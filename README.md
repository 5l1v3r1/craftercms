2 Create a Development Environment
======

The following steps will guide you on the creation of a authoring and live environments of Crafter CMS.

### 2.1 Building a Crafter CMS Authoring environment 
*_An Authoring environment is where an Author can safely create and manage content without impacting the end-user's live system_*
Once all he sources had been download you can run
```bash
    ./gradlew authEnv
```
The Gradle task above will:
1. Delete any existing _Authoring environment_in `crafter-auth-env` folder. *It will always make a clean Authoring environment*
2. Download Apache Tomcat and Solr. (Check the Gradle section on how to spesifed a version of tomcat an solr)
3. Build all Crafter CMS components from the source (check the Git section on how to update the source).
4. Create a folder name `crafter-auth-env` and copy all needed resources for a *clean* and functional Authoring environment.

### 2.1.2. Run
To run the _Authoring environment_ you can:
* Run the gradle task 

```bash
./gradlew runAuth
```
or
 
* Run it manually 

```bash
cd `crafter-auth-env`
./startup.sh
```

Both of thoese options will:

* Start Apache tomcat on default ports (8080,8009,8005) [See Gradle task on how to change default ports]#GradleTasks
* Start Solr server on port 8984
* Start Crafter Deployer on port 

### 2.1.3 Authoring Environment Scripts

with
