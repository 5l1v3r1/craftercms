Crafter Services
----------------

Crafter CMS is built with Java along a micro-service architecture and comprises a number of services that together provide the full solution.

To author and manage content, you'll be using Crafter Studio and content will ultimately be delivered to the content consumers via Crafter Engine, making it a decoupled CMS.

Crafter Studio is the content authoring, management and publishing application that allows marketers and content editors to create rich web experiences.
